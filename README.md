lcm-spy-lite
============

LCM-Spy-Lite is a lightweight terminal-based implementation of LCM-Spy. This tool allows a developer to observe LCM (https://code.google.com/p/lcm) messages in transit for debugging purposes.

LCM-Spy-Lite is very useful on emebeded systems where the Java Runtime Environnment and X11-forwarding (as required by LCM-Spy) is prohibitive. LCM-Spy-Lite requires only a Unix System, the LCM library, and a C99 compiler.
